🧠 What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

✅ Key Characteristics
Feature	Description
Open Source	Free to modify & distribute
Multi-User	Multiple users can access simultaneously
Multi-Tasking	Run multiple tasks at once
Secure	File permissions & SELinux support
Stable & Scalable	Used in servers, cloud, DevOps, AI, etc.
🏗️ Linux Distributions

A Linux distribution = Linux kernel + utilities + package manager

Category	Examples	Notes
Enterprise OS	RHEL, CentOS, Rocky Linux, SUSE	Production servers
Community OS	Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora	Free and popular
Security OS	Kali Linux	Ethical hacking
Cloud OS	Amazon Linux	AWS servers
🟥 What is RHEL?

RHEL = Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Enterprise-grade OS for production servers

Widely used in corporate & cloud environments

Paid support & security patching

✅ If you're learning Linux for DevOps, AWS, Kubernetes, or Cybersecurity, RHEL-based systems are highly recommended.

🖥️ Accessing RHEL
Local Access

Physical / Virtual Machine login

GUI login (GNOME)

Terminal access (CLI)

Remote Access

Using SSH from Windows/macOS/Linux:

ssh cloud-user@SERVER-IP

🟦 Basic Linux Commands
Action	Command
Display username	whoami
Display hostname	hostname
Show present working directory	pwd
List files	ls
Change directory	cd /path
Clear screen	clear or Ctrl + L
Check system date	date
Check calendar	cal
📂 Linux Directory Structure

Linux uses a tree-based file system:

Directory	Purpose
/	Root of filesystem
/home/	User home directories
/root/	Root user home
/etc/	Configuration files
/var/	Logs, variable data
/usr/	User binaries, libraries
/bin/	Basic commands (ls, cp, mv)
/sbin/	System binaries
/tmp/	Temp files
/opt/	Optional applications
/dev/	Device files
/boot/	Kernel files
👤 Users & Superuser

Linux has two types of users:

Type	Description
Normal User	Limited privileges
Superuser (root)	Complete control

Switch to root:

su -


Execute command as root:

sudo <command>

🔍 Getting Help in Linux
Purpose	Command
Command manual	man <command>
Command help	<command> --help
Search manual	man -k <keyword>
What command does	which <command>
Example:
man ls
ls --help
which cp

🚪 Login & Logout Commands
Action	Command
Login	via SSH or GUI
Logout session	exit
Reboot system	reboot
Shutdown system	shutdown -h now
⌨️ Shell & Terminal Basics

Linux shell = command interpreter
Common shells:

bash (default in RHEL)

sh

zsh

Check shell:

echo $SHELL

🧪 Hands-On Practice

Run these commands:

whoami
hostname
pwd
ls -l
cd /etc
pwd
ls
cd ~
date
cal
man ls

💡 Real-World Example

SSH into a server and list logs:

ssh cloud-user@192.168.1.10
cd /var/log
ls -lh
